# Day 5

## Task breakdown

1. Move all crates
2. Tell which crates are on top

## Flowchart

## Notes

* Getting mixed up on chaining
* But also getting better
* Still wrapping my head around transposing
  * Seems like Kotlin doesn't have as easy a way working with 2d collections for me
  * Figure out transposing and get one/some generic functions into Utils.kt
